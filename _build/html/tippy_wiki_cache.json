{"%22Hello,_World!%22_program": "<p>\nA <b>\"Hello, World!\" program</b> is usually a simple computer program that emits to the screen a message similar to \"Hello, World!\". A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. Such a program is often the first written by a student of a new programming language, but it can also be used as a sanity check to ensure that the computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.</p>"}
