    "# Initialisation\n",
    "\n",
    "{term}`Initialisation` is the setting of the intial value of a variable for the first time (at the time of {term}`construction`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Definiton is therefore decalaration plus initialisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialisation is different from assignment because there is no previous value involved and initialization is done by {term}`constructors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice is to always initialise your variables – the benefits include preventing you from accidentally tyring to use a variable that has been declared, but not defined.\n",

    "Don't declare a variable until you have a value for it.\n",

    "The exceptions are `string` and `vector`. Both are initialised by default as empty - `\"\"` for `string`, `v.capacity() = 0` for `vector`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by a ‘default constructor’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global built-in type variables are initialised with default of 0 – but you should not use global variables in the first place and 0 is just as problematic as no value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial value may be provided in the initializer section of a declarator or a new expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initialisation also takes place during function calls: function parameters and the function return values are both initialized.\n",

    "## Auto\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of simple variable can be deduced fr\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining a variable, you don’t actually need to state its type explicitly when it can be deduced from the initializer:\n",

    "auto ch = 'x'; //  Single quotes are reserved to denote `char` type\n",

    "With auto, we use the = syntax because there is no type conversion involved that might cause problems.\n",
    "We use auto where we don’t hav e a specific reason to mention the type explicitly. ‘‘Specific reasons’’ include:\n",
    "* The definition is in a large scope where we want to make the type clearly visible to readers of our code.\n",
    "* We want to be explicit about a variable’s range or precision (e.g., double rather than float).\n",
    "Using auto, we avoid redundancy and writing long type names. This is especially important in generic programming where the exact type of an object can be hard for the programmer to know and the type names can be quite long (§4.5.1).\n",
    "There is no advantage to using {} initialization, and one trap, when using auto to get the type determined by the initializer. The trap is that if the initializer is a {}-list, we may not want its type deduced (§6.3.6.2). For example:\n",

    "std::vector<double> v(10, 3.3); // use constructor : v gets 10 elements initialized to 3.3st constructor \n",
    "\n",
    "To access pi – you need to include numbers and GOTO properties, c++language standard, select version 20++.\n",
    " In a declaration, an empty pair of parentheses, (), always means ‘‘function’’ (§12.1). So, if you\n",
    "want to be explicit about ‘‘use default initialization’’ you need {}. For example:\n",
    "std::complex<double> z1(1, 2); // function-style initializer (initialization by constructor)\n",
    "std::complex<double> f1(); // function declaration\n",
    "std::complex<double> z2{ 1,2 }; // initialization by constructor to {1,2}\n",
