    "# Initialisation\n",
    "\n",
    "{term}`Initialisation` is the setting of the intial value of a variable for the first time (at the time of {term}`construction`).\n",
    "\n",
    "{term}`Definiton` is therefore {term}`decalaration` combined with initialisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialisation is different from assignment - the object has no previous value AND initialization is done by a {term}`constructor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice is to always initialise your variables – the benefits include preventing you from accidentally tyring to use a variable that has been declared, but not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    ":class: margin\n",
    "Don't declare a variable until you have a value for it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The exceptions are the `string` and `vector` tyeps - both are initialised by 'default' as 'empty' i.e. `\"\"` for a `string`, `v.capacity() = 0` for a `vector`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by a 'default constructor'. We will learn about contructors when we study {term}`classes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global built-in type variables are initialised with default of 0 – but you should not use global variables in the first place and '0' can be just as problematic as no value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial value may be provided in the initializer section of a declarator or by a new expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initialisation also takes place during function calls: function parameters and the function return values are both initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialisers\n",
    "There a differnt ways to intialise an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an {term}`initialiser` is specified for an object, that initializer determines the initial value of an object.\n",

    "One of the primary benefits of list-initialization for new C++ programmers is that “narrowing conversions” are disallowed. This means that if you try to list-initialize a variable using a value that the variable can not safely hold, the compiler is required to produce a diagnostic (compilation error or warning) to notify you. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "int main()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // An integer can only hold non-fractional values.\n",
    "    // Initializing an int with fractional value 4.5 requires the compiler to convert 4.5 to a value an int can hold.\n",

    "\n",
    "Copy-initialization (line 9) and direct-initialization (line 10) both silently drop the .5 and initialize the variable with the value 4 (which probably isn’t what we want). Your compiler may warn you about this (since losing data is rarely desired), but it also may not.\n",

    "If the entity being initialized is a reference, see reference initialization.\n",

    "We use auto where we don’t hav e a specific reason to mention the type explicitly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Specific reasons\" include:\n",
    "* The definition is in a large scope where we want to make the type clearly visible to readers of our code.\n",
    "* We want to be explicit about a variable’s range or precision (e.g., double rather than float).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using auto, we avoid redundancy and writing long type names. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially important in generic programming where the exact type of an object can be hard for the programmer to know and the type names can be quite long.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no advantage to using {} initialization, and one trap, when using auto to get the type determined by the initializer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The trap is that if the initializer is a {}-list, we may not want its type deduced. For example:\n",

    "If no initializer is specified, a `global`, `namespace`, `local static`, or `static member` (static objects) is initialized to `{}` of the appropriate type. For example:\n",
