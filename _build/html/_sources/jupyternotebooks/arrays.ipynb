    "All computing languages use containers to collect multiple elements together into a single object, e.g. collecting a list of 5 numbers under a single variable named 'myList'.\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is the C++ fundamental method for representing a sequence of objects in memory, part of the core language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple fixed-length sequence of objects, all the same given type in memory, an array is the ideal solution. However, these built-in arrays do no not offer sufficient flexibility and typically programmers prefer to use standard library containers such as `vector`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays can be constructed from any of the fundamental types, including pointers, classes and enumerations - but not from references or functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of elements in an array is fixed at declaration, and the values are fixed at initialisation.\n",

    "type arrayName[...number of elements...];\n",
    "```\n",
    "The number of elements of an array is called the array bound - which must be an integer literal, or a `const int` expression that evaluates to greater than zero and is not optional in a declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a type `T`, `T[N]` is of type 'array of N elements of type T'. e.g. int myArray[10], has the type 'array of 10 int's' - often just 'int array'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The type may not be pointer or reference types. To make an array of pointers parentheses must be used see {ref}`Pointers and Arrays`.\n",
