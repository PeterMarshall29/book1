    "An expression is a sequence of operators and their operands, that specifies a computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression evaluation may produce a result (e.g. evaluation of 2 + 2 produces the result 4) and may generate side-effects (unexpected behaviours). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each C++ expression is characterized by two independent properties: A {term}`type` and a {term}`value category`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations and Operators\n",
    "Each {term}`type` can only be operated on by specific operators. It would not make sense for every operator to work on all types or in the same way on different types, e.g. multiplication using `*` on two strings would make no sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some operators are **overloaded** - meaning they do work on different types, but not necessarily in the same manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `+` is the addition operator for arithmetic types, but the {term}`concatenation` operator for `string` and `char` types.\n",
