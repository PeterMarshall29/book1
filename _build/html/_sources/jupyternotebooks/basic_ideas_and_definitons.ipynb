    "# Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have mastered some basic components of the C++ language, learning the language becomes much easier, because you will be able to write simple programmes to try out each new concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page leads you through some basic exercises, much of the explanation is left until later chapters - this page is not intended to present the full syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Computational Physics module, we are mainly concerned with writing programmes that will take user inputs, perform calculations, and then return the 'answers' to the user, which requires us to learn only a subset of the C++ language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer program is a sequence of statements, which are executed sequentially when the program runs.\n",
    "````{syntax} Types of Statement\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    ":nonumber: \n",
    "C++ includes the following types of statements:\n",
    "* Labelled statements - adds a label to another type of statement, to allow control of the flow.\n",
    "* Expression statements\n",
    "* Compound statements\n",
    "* [Selection](selection) statements\n",
    "* [Iteration](iteration) statements\n",
    "* [Jump statements]\n",
    "````\n",
    "The simplest type of statement is an {term}`expression statement` - i.e. an {term}`expression` followed by a {term}`terminator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are sequences of {term}`operators` and their {term}`operands`, which specify a computation e.g. `a+b` is an expression, `a` and `b` are operands and `+` is an operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the expression statement is executed, the expression is evaluated by the computer, producing a result, which will have a {term}`value` and a {term}`type`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements are always terminated by either a semicolon `;` or by `{}` which represents a {term}`code-block` i.e. {...some code here...}, which may be empty or contain statements.\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    ":class: margin\n",
    "Only {term}`directives` do not require termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `#include <iostream>`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    ":class: margin\n",
    "The Visual Studio IDE indicates a missing `;` by highlighting the start of the next line of code.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    ":class: margin\n",
    "Forgetting to terminate a statement, will result in a compile-time error. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A semicolon is a statement terminator, and by itself a statement, an {term}`empty statement` (null statement). \n",
    "\n",
    "An expression statement without an expression is called a {term}`null statement`, which may be used to provide an empty body to a for or while loop, or to carry a label in the end of a compound statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Arithmetic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "All programming languages carry out basic arithmetic operations. Normally we do not use a computer as a simple calculator, but most programmes carry out some arithmetic operations as part of their execution.\n",

The difference is that in maths the variable 'x' represents an unknown value, but in computing the variable called 'x' represents a specific value of a particular {term}`type` that is stored in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The {term}`name` allows the {term}`value` to be identified when needed, and the value of 'x' may be accessed (read or copied) or changed (not always permitted). \n",
