    "## Pointer Arithmetic and Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of an array is actually a pointer to the ﬁrst element in the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Writing `myArray[3]` tells the compiler to return the element that is 3 away from the starting el­ement of myArray. \n",
    "\n",
    "This explains why arrays are always passed by reference: passing an array is really passing a pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also explains why array indices start at 0: the ﬁrst element of an array is the element that is 0 away from the start of the array\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pointer Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointer arithmetic is a way of using subtraction and addition of pointers to move around between locations in memory, typically between array elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding an integer 'n' to a pointer produces a new pointer pointing to 'n' positions further down in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the following code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    "long arr[] = {6,0,9,8};\n",
    "long* ptr = arr;\n",

    "std::cout << *ptr << '\\n';\n",
    "std::cout << ptr2 << '\\n';\n",
    "std::cout << *ptr2 << '\\n';\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Pointer Expressions and Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "A limited set of arithmetic operations can be performed on pointers which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "incremented ( ++ )\n",
    "decremented ( — )\n",
    "an integer may be added to a pointer ( + or += )\n",
    "an integer may be subtracted from a pointer ( – or -= )\n",
    "difference between two pointers (p1-p2)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: Pointer arithmetic is meaningless unless performed on an array.) \n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    "include <iostream>       // standard IO\n",
    "int main() {\n",

    "## Void\n",
    "\n",
    "In low-level code, we occasionally need to store or pass along an address of a memory location without actually knowing what type of object is stored there. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `void∗` is used for that purpose; you can read `void∗` as \"pointer to an object of unknown type\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions using `void*` pointers typically exist at the very lowest level of the system, where real hardware resources are manipulated. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    "void* my_alloc(size_t n);   // allocate n bytes from my special heap\n",
    "```\n",
    "Occurrences of `void*` at higher levels of the system should be viewed with great suspicion because they are likely indicators of design errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where used for optimization, `void*` can be hidden behind a type-safe interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointers to functions and pointers to members cannot be assigned to `void*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `nullptr`\n",
    "\n",
    "The literal `nullptr` represents the null pointer, that is, a pointer that does not point to an object. It can be assigned to any pointer type, but not to other built-in types:\n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    "int* pi = nullptr;  double* pd = nullptr;     int i = nullptr;      // error: i is not a pointer\n",
    "int* p = NULL; // using the macro NULL\n",
    "```\n",
    "There is just one `nullptr`, which can be used for every pointer type, rather than a null pointer for each pointer type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before nullptr was introduced, zero (0) was used as a notation for the null pointer. For example:\n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    "int* x= 0; // x gets the value nullptr\n",
    "```\n",
    "No object is allocated with the address '0', and '0' (the all-zeros bit pattern) is the most common representation of 'nullptr'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Zero (0) is an `int`. However, the standard conversions allow '0' to be used as a constant of 'pointer' or 'pointer-to-member' type.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been popular to define a macro `NULL` to represent the 'null pointer'. For example:\n",
    "However, there are differences in the definition of NULL in different implementations; for example,\n",
    "NULL might be 0 or 0L. \n",
    "\n",
    "In C, `NULL` is typically `(void*)0`, which makes it illegal in C++:\n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    "int* p = NULL; // error: can’t assign a void* to an int*\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",

    "## Pointers into Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, pointers and arrays are closely related. The name of an array can be used as a pointer to its initial element. For example:\n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    "int v[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };\n",
    "int* p1 = v; // pointer to initial element (implicit conversion)\n",
    "int* p2 = &v[0]; // pointer to initial element\n",
    "int* p3 = v + 4; // pointer to one-beyond-last element\n",
    "int* p4 = v + 2; // pointer to other elements\n",
    "std::cout << v << '\\n';\n",
    "std::cout << p1 << '\\n';\n",
    "std::cout << *p1 << '\\n';\n",
    "std::cout << p3 << '\\n';\n",
    "std::cout << *p3 << '\\n';\n",
    "std::cout << p4 << '\\n';\n",
    "std::cout << *p4 << '\\n'; \n",
    "```\n",
    "Taking a pointer to the element one beyond the end of an array is guaranteed to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is important for many algorithms However, since such a pointer does not in fact point to an element of the array, it may not be used for reading or writing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result of taking the address of the element before the initial element or beyond one-past-the-last element is undefined and should be avoided. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    "int* p4 = v−1; // before the beginning, undefined: don’t do it\n",
    "int* p5 = v + 7; // beyond the end, undefined: don’t do it\n",
    "```\n",
    "The implicit conversion of an array name to a pointer to the initial element of the array is extensively used in function calls in C-style code. For example:\n",
    "// extern \"C\" int strlen(const char*);   // from <string.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    "void f() {\n",
    "\tchar v[] = \"Annemarie\";\n",
    "\tchar* p = v;  // implicit conversion of char[] to char*\n",

    "\tstd::cout << strlen(v) << '\\n';   // implicit conversion of char[] to char*\n",
    "\t//v = p;     // error: cannot assign to array\n",
    "\t }\n",
    "int main() { f(); }\n",
    "```\n",
    "The same value is passed to the standard-library function strlen() in both calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "The snag is that it is impossible to avoid the implicit conversion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, there is no way of declaring a function so that the array v is copied when the function is called. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is no implicit or explicit conversion from a pointer to an array. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implicit conversion of the array argument to a pointer means that the size of the array is lost to the called function. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the called function must somehow determine the size to perform a meaningful operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like other C standard-library functions taking pointers to characters, `strlen()` relies on zero to indicate end-of-string; `strlen(p)` returns the number of characters up to and not including the terminating '0'. This is all pretty low-level. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard-library `vector`, `array`, and `string` don’t suffer from this problem. These library types give their number of elements as their `size()` without having to count elements each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pointers to Functions\n",
    "Like a (data) object, the code generated for a function body is placed in memory somewhere and therefore has a unique address associated with it and therefore we can also define a pointer to a function in a similar manner to a pointer to an object.  There are some differences however:\n",

    "A pointer to function does not allow the code to be modified. \n",
