    "A branch of algebra used to describe logical operations - with the following distinguishing features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean variables may only have the value `true` or `false` - called truth values - which are generally represented by `1` and `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean variables are operands for Boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`, and others) - normal algebraic rules do not apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1937 Shannon proved that the behaviour of certain types of electrical circuit was logically equivalent to Boolean algebra.\n",
    "````\n",
    "Computers operate using Boolean logic, i.e. the electronic circuits are a physical manifestation of two-value Boolean logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean operations required that the computer circuits can be in one of two distinct states, representing `true` or `false`. This is achieved in various ways, the simplest being that the voltage in a wire is either 0 or a positive value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-state Boolean logic is not the only possibility, but it is the simplest to implement. Using 4 states would offer some advantages, but currently itâ€™s simpler to use 2 wires to get 4 possible states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming a Boolean, `bool`, is a fundamental integer data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each `bool` may hold only the integer values `1` or `0`, which represent `true` and `false` respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans are used in conditional statements to determine the control flow depending on whether a conditional expression evaluates to true or false.\n",
