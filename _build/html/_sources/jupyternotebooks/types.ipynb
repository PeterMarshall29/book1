    "# Types in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "The **type** of a variable defines its properties, the rules it must obey, and the set of operators and functions available to members of each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `+` behaves differently when used an {term}`infix operator` between two integers, compared to between two strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of integers yields a different numerical value than the addition of the `char` representation of the same numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would not make much sense to be able to add string-type to double-type variables, and the `type system` helps by preventing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object, reference, function, expression in C++ is associated with a type, which may be fundamental, compound, or user-defined, complete or incomplete, etc.\n",
    "## Fundamental Types in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Types defined in the {term}`core language` are the {term}`fundamental types`:\n",
    "- Integral Types: `int`, `char`, `bool`, and variants.\n",
    "- Floating-point Types: `float`, `double`, etc..\n",
    "- Void\n",
    "\n",
    "{term}`Void` is a type used to signify the absence of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integral and floating-point types are collectively called the arithmetic types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other 'built-in' types, are constructed using declarator operators, including: pointer types `int*`, simple array type, `char[]`, and reference types `double&` and `vector<int>&&`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The types in the {term}`standard library` are **derived types** constructed using the types in the core language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers can define their own 'user-defined' types. Using a {term}`class`, or a {term}`template`, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "## C++ is a **strongly-typed language**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a variable type is set, for example when a number is cast as a **double**, the type cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, type conversion is possible - by copying the value from a variable of one type to a new variable of the different type.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called {term}`casting to type`. Casting required conversion from one type to another - there are some inbuilt conversions, and others may be created by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strict type enforcement offers benefits to both efficiency and safety. It would be difficult to keep track of the type of a variable if it could be changed and would require frequent type checking to ensure no errors, which takes time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type System and Type Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "All expressions (including literal values) are implicitly given a type by the compiler before they're evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C++ type system is a fundamental aspect of the language - a set of rules applied by the compiler that ensure every variable, function argument, return value, and expression has a specific type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C++ type system keeps track of the size of the memory block, and how to interpret the value in it. The binary code in a memory block could represent the integer value 33 or be the ASCII code for '!' - the type tells the computer which was intended. This system provides structure, safety, and meaning to the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, all expressions (including literal values) are implicitly given a type by the compiler before they're evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type system ensure type safety - the guarantee that an object can be accessed only according to its definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "C++ is highly type safe, but a programmer can still violate type safety by explicit casting, by using an uninitialized variable, by using a pointer that doesn't point to an object, by accessing beyond the end of an array, and by misusing a union. Type safety must be preserved for a program to be correct and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Casting to Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the type of a variable cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a variable can be copy assigned to another variable that has a different type  - not all permutations are permitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Casting to type, means conversion from the original type to the type of the variable that the value is being assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often useful, and often necessary when working with numeric types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Casting may be implicit or explicit.\n",

    "Some types are automatically converted by the compiler if there is a mismatch and the type conversion required is one of the permitted built-in conversions - called implicit casting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit casting occurs when a single expression is found to include multiple types. e.g. attempted addition of an `int` to a `double` - although they are both numbers, a decision needs to be made about the type of the result, and some possible operations behave differently between types, such as division.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler must have a set of rules for each possible conversion - programmers need to be aware of what rule might be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "For numeric values - this is called type promotion - the type with the smallest precision is converted to the type with the larger precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type promotion occurs in arithmetic expressions, when the types are mismatched, but convertible, and in functions, if the passed in types is smaller than the expected type.\n",

    "\n",
    "`rvalue` means \"a value that is not an `lvalue`\", such as a temporary value (e.g., the value returned by a function). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two properties that matter for an object when it comes to addressing, copying, and moving: \n",
    "• Has identity: The program has the name of, pointer to, or reference to the object so that it is possible to determine if two objects are the same, whether the value of the object has changed, etc.\n",
    "• Movable: The object may be moved from (i.e., we are allowed to move its value to another location and leave the object in a valid but unspecified state, rather than copying). \n",
    "\n",
    "For practical programming, thinking in terms of `rvalue` and `lvalue` is usually sufficient. Note that every expression is either an `lvalue` or an `rvalue`, but not both.\n",
