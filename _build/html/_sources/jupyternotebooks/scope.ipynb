    "Different distinguishable parts of a program's structure are called {term}`scopes`; for example, the statements inside different functions are said to have different scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of a declaration introduces the identified entity into the scope at that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects declared in different scopes can use the same identifier i.e. you can have lots of variables called `i`. The purpose of a scope is to keep names 'local\", so that they cannot interfere with identical names declared elsewhere.\n",

    "Always use indenting to reinforce scoping changes.\n",

    "* Global: Names declared outside of all other scopes i.e. outside of any function or class; sometimes called the global namespace.\n",
    "* Namespace: A named scope - creates a separate scope within the global scope or within another namespace.\n",
    "* Class: Everything with the class definition - may be subclasses with the area of text within a class.\n",
    "* Local scope: Accessible only within the block where they are declared i.e. between `{ }`, or in a function argument list.\n",
    "* Statement scopes: e.g. in a for-statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope names are often used as adjectives describing entities: e.g. global variable, local variable, statement (loop) variable.\n",

    "Function scopes:\n",
