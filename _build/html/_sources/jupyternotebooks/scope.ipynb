    "\n",
    "A variable with {term}`global scope`  Variables declared outside of all functions or classes have global scope. Global variables are accessible throughout the program, unless shadowed by a local variable with the same name. Global variables are best avoided unless necessary because they may result in unintended consequences in execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to keep in mind the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "In each scope, local variables are used in preference to others with the same name, this is called {term}`shadowing`.\n",
    "A local variable will be used in preference to a global variable of the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables cannot be accessed outside of their scope, loop variable, function parameters only exist inside their scope. Class and struct variables can be accessed by indexing in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make global variable have long detailed names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use global variables if possible, its hard to keep track of which functions may be altering their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of a program is often said to be inversely proportional to the number of global variables as the index of an exponential – keep it to one or two at most.\n",
    " \n",
    "Blocks: Blocks within functions (nested blocks) or other block have their own scope\n",
    "Functions: Local or nested functions\n",
    "Classes: Classes can have member classes; classes within another class, also called nested classes.\n",
    "Local classes are those declared with in functions – best avoided – function is too long if it benefits from the use of a class.\n",
    "A member definition can be outside its class, provided it is declared inside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside: Void f(); // declaration\n",
    "Outside: Void MyClassName::f() {} // the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shadowing\n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually possible to use the same name more than once, provided each declaration has different scope.\n",

    "## Namespace\n",
    "Namespace is a language feature exclusively used to express scoping.\n",
    "Creating a namespace allows you to write sperate parts of a longer program without fear that the names used will not have been used elsewhere.\n",
    " \n",
