    "\n",
    "In C++ there are a range of character sets and character set encodings available. Char variables are represented by 8 bits, which puts a limit on the character set of 256 items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic, and default character type is `char`. There will be no immediate need to look into any others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A char-type variable can hold a character of the implementation’s character set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Char type is created using single quotes `' '` around a character literal. For example: \n",
    "```{code-block} cpp\n",
    "char myCharacter = 'Z';\n",
    "```\n",
    "The character set we are using is called ASCII,  (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) that represents 128 characters chosen to match the characters appearing on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "`0` is also used as a null pointer constant, and as the {term}`null character`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different countries with different symbol requirements for their keyboards (e.g., æ, þ, and ß) will use different character sets and you must never rely on char values for the execution of a published program.\n",

    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "* char: Default character type - used for program text - usually 8 bits.\n",
    "* signed char: Like char, but for signed character representation - able of holding both positive and negative values.\n",
    "* wchar_t: Provided to hold characters of a larger character set such as Unicode. The size of wchar_t is implementation-defined and large enough to hold the largest character set supported by the implementation’s locale.\n",
    "* char16_t: A type for holding 16-bit character sets, such as UTF-16.\n",
    "* char32_t: A type for holding 32-bit character sets, such as UTF-32.\n",
