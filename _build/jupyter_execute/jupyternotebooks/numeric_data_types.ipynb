    "By default, a floating-point literal is of type double. Again, a compiler ought to warn about floating-\n",
    "point literals that are too large to be represented. Here are some floating-point literals:\n",
    "1.23 .23 0.23 1. 1.0 1.2e10 1.23e−15\n",
    "Note that a space cannot occur in the middle of a floating-point literal. For example, 65.43 e−21 is not a floating-point literal but rather four separate lexical tokens (causing a syntax error):\n",
    "65.43 e − 21\n",
    "If you want a floating-point literal of type float, you can define one using the suffix f or F:\n",
    "3.14159265f 2.0f 2.997925F 2.9e−3f\n",
    "If you want a floating-point literal of type long double, you can define one using the suffix l or L:\n",

    "Some implementation-defined aspects of fundamental types can be found by a simple use of sizeof, and more can be found in <limits>. For example:\n",

    "}\n",
    "The functions in <limits> (§40.2) are constexpr (§10.4) so that they can be used without run-time overhead and in contexts that require a constant expression."
