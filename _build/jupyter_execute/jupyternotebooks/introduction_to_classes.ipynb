    "The `class` keyword declares a class or defines an object of class type. A class is a user-defined type, consisting of a set of members, and each class is a new namespace containing its members. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common members are \"data members\" (variables) and \"member functions\", followed by operators and some other language features.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of a class is created in the same way as an instance of a `double` or an `int` and new instances of classes are referred to as objects - hence object-oriented programming primarily refers to the use of instances of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every class is divided into two parts, members are designated as `private` (by default if unspecified) and `public`. The public members provide the class's interface, and the private members provide implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `struct` is a `class` where all members are public by default - so you already know a lot about creating and working with classes. The notes used to introduce `struct`s last semester have been added to a page on this web resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "Member functions can access the data members and are the only functions that can access private data members - all the functionality and behaviour of the new type is defined by its member functions, which includes defining initialization (creation), copy and move, and destruction (cleanup = freeing no longer required memory/storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "Members are accessed using . (dot) for objects and `->` (arrow) for pointers. Operators, such as `+`, `!`, and `[]`, can be defined for a class.\n",

    "**inline** functions are compiled such that their code is repeated at the point of call, rather than code being added for the function call mechanism so that the code runs at the point of call. Depending on what the function does, inlining can improve performance, a compiler could even replace the function with the value it would have obtained if value can be computed at compile time, whereas a normal function would always wait and run during the program execution. Adding `inline` at the beginning of a function definition does nothing else and is ignore if not suitable under the circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any member function can be declared as inline by adding the `inline` keyword to its definition outside of the class definition, which retains the separation of declaration and definition that is preferred for classes, separating interface and implementation.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are certain member functions, called the **special member functions** that a user defined class may require but which the user does not always need to explicitly define themselves, which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The default constructor\n",
    "* The destructor\n",
    "* The copy constructor\n",
    "* The copy assignment operator\n",
    "* The move constructor\n",
    "* The move assignment operator\n",
    "\n",
    "If you define a class but do not explicitly define some required member functions, the compiler will implicitly declare and define default version of these special members for you, but only if an implementation of the special member function is required by your class. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can explicitly declare a default special member function by using the = default keyword. This causes the compiler to define the function only if needed, in the same way as if the function was not declared at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Default Copying\n",
    "By default, objects can be copied. A class object can be initialized with a copy of an object of its class. For example: \n",
    "```{code-block}  cpp\n",
    ":linenos:\n",
    "Date date1 = my_birthday; // initialization by copy\n",
    "Date date2{ my_birthday }; // initialization by copy\n",
    "```\n",
    "The copy of a class object contains a copy of each member - If that default is not the behaviour wanted for a class X, a more \n",
    "appropriate behaviour can be provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, class objects can be copied by assignment. For example:\n",
    "```{code-block} cpp\n",
    ":linenos:\n",
    "void f(Date& d) {\n",
    "  date = my_birthday;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Again, the default semantics is a member-wise copy. Alternatively, for a class X, the user can define an appropriate assignment operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Destructors\n",
    "\n",
    "For larger programs, especially those using resources such as files that burden the system memory, it is important to keep track of memory utilisation and to clean up unneeded allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A destructor is a special member function that cleans up any resources allocated to a class instance when no longer required, i.e. when the instantiated object goes out of scope. Every instance of the same class is terminated by a separate call to the class destructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `main()` returns, all the allocated memory is freed up. Generally, we do not need to write a destructor - the compiler generated default destructor is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The destructor takes the name of the class preceded by the tild `~` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} cpp\n",
    ":linenos:\n",
    "~MyClassName(){};\n",
    "```\n",
    "There is little point in writing your own destructor, unless you utilise the body of the destructor for something useful - otherwise let the compiler construct the default destructor for you.\n",

    "## Using Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can be used as objects inside other classes i.e. the member list of one class can have a named instance of another class. An instance of the new class is then storing data within an instance of the other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way the new class is a superset of the data stored in the class it contains - we could take the view that the construct represented by the new class is also a version of the construct represented by the contained class with some added information.\n",

    "## Function Objects - Functors\n",
    "\n",
    "A function object, or functor, is any type that implements `operator()`, which overloads the function call operator `()`. C++ provides many built-in function objects, and you will have a called a function object without realising it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A functor is a class designed to mimic a function i.e. it can be called like a function or function pointer, allowing objects of a class to be called like functions, but still having the advantages of a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Function objects provide some advantages over regular functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A function object can be used wherever an object can be used i.e. it can be passed to a function as an argument or returned from a function.\n",
    "- A function object can have a state i.e. it can hold information from one call to another.\n",
    "- Inheritance applies - new function objects can be derived from existing ones.\n",
    "- Being types function objects can be used as a template parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function objects allow us to write code that takes nontrivial operations as parameters; in many cases, it is essential that function objects can hold data needed to perform their operation.\n",
