    "\n",
    "A class is a user-defined type, consisting of a set of members. The most common members are \"data members\" (variables) and \"member functions\", followed by operators and some other language features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Member functions can define the meaning of initialization (creation), copy, move, and cleanup (destruction).\n",
    "Members are accessed using . (dot) for objects and `−>` (arrow) for pointers.\n",
    "Operators, such as `+`, `!`, and `[]`, can be defined for a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a namespace containing its members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every class is divide into two parts - the interface and the implementation. The public members provide the class's interface, and the private members provide implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "A struct is a class where members are by default public.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `class` keyword declares a class or defines an object of class type\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of a class is created by \n",
    "\n",
    "Instances of classes are referred to as objects - hence object-oriented programming primarily refers to the use of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic classes are almost the same as structs that we covered last term.\n",
    "\n",

    "  void add_day(int n); // add n days\n",
    "};\n",

    "This is equivalent to:\n",

    "Members are private by default - so anything before the private `public` keyword is autoatically `private`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`private`, `public`, and `protected` (covered in later section) are called **access specifiers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key points to remember are that: \n",
    "* Private data members may not be initialisd by assignment - a constructor or member-initisation-function is required\n",
    "* Non-member function may not access private members of a class.\n",
    "* Private data members may not be access by index notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the `private` keyword is also used, the order of the public and private members does not matter, and it is sometimes useful to lead with the public member functions, just to add emphasis to their role as interface to the class. The 'private' and 'public' keywords may be used more than once each, for a large class this might be helpful, but should generally be avoided because to reduce potential confusion.  \n",

    "The correct approach to initialisation of an instance of a class is via a constuctor; the other option is member function that serves the same purpose, which is pointless for classes and increase the danger of an object being left unitialised.\n",

    "## Member Intialiser Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred way to write a contstuctor is to add include a `term`{member intialiser list}, which initialise class data members before the body of the constuctor is evaluated.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Default Member Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Class declarations may include intialisation of data members (non-static only), the values are then defaul values for an instances of the class.\n",

    "When a date member is declared as `static` there is a single copy of that member, which is shared by all instances of that class i.e. change it once, change it everywhere!\n",
    "\n",
    "Static member declarations cannot contain an initialiser i.e. a default value cannot be assigned in the declaration.\n",

    "## Default Copying\n",
    "By default, objects can be copied. Aclass object can be initialized with a copy of an object of its class. For example: \n",

    "void f(Date& d)\n",
    "{\n",
