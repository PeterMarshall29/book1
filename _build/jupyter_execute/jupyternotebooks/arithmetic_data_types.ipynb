    "# Arithmetic Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of numeric data types but to start learning C++ we really only need two of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default integer type use for integers and the double type for numbers with decimal points including those in scientific notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integer Types\n",
    "\n",
    "`int` is the keyword for the default {term}`integer type`. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a set of other integer types: `int` may be preceded by one or two modifiers - `signed`, `unsigned`, `short`, `long`, `long long`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The modifiers may also be used on their own, and `int` is implied; but `signed` and `unsigned` may also precede `char`, and `long` may precede `double`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer literal is just the number itself as opposed to an `int` which is a variable of type `int` having an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer literals must not be written with a decimal point i.e. do not write the number seven as 7.0, this will be interpreted as a floating-point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Floating-Point Literals\n",
    "`Float` and `double` are both used for {term}`floating-point numbers` - \"double\" denoting double precision (meaning twice as many bits are used to represent the double values in binary code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of how floating-point literal may be typed: `3.14`, `.14`, `-3.`, `2.99e8`, `6.63eâˆ’34`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point numbers are expressed to different levels of precision; `float` for single precision (32-bit), `double` for double precision(64-bit), and `long double for extended precision (80-bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "A floating-point literal is of interpreted to be of type `double` by default, but to reduce memory usuage using a `float` or when larger values are required using `long double`, the suffix f, or l may be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "A floating-point literal of type `float` is defined by adding the postfix 'f' (or 'F') to the number:  `2.997925F`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `long double` is defined by adding the postfix 'l' (or 'L'): `5.55e207L`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific Notation\n",
    "Scientific notation is formated using a lower, or upper, case `e` between the mantissa and the index **no whitespace** is permitted.\n",
    "`````{sidebar}\n",
    "````{admonition} Scientific Notation Example\n",
    "$2.99e8 = 2.99 \\times 10^{8}$\n",
    "````\n",
    "`````\n",
    "The syntax does not permit any whitespace in a floating point literal. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 2.998 e8 is not a floating-point literal, and would be intpreted as three separate lexical tokens and cause a syntax error at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "(SizeOfNumericValues)=\n",
    "## Max Size of Numeric Values\n",
    "The maximum value that can be storde by each {term}`numeric data type` depends on number of bits used by the computer architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most computers use 64 bits, meaning that 64 bits are used to represent addresses in memory, allowing larger numbers to be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 64 bit architecture means that processors are able to load and store 64 bit floating point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer values do not follow a \n",
    "On a 64 bits system: `int` uses 32 bits: `short` uses 16 bits, and `long` uses 64 bits.\n",
