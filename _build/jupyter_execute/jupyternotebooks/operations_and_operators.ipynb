    "\n",
    "An expression is a sequence of operators and their operands, that specifies a computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression evaluation may produce a result (e.g., evaluation of 2 + 2 produces the result 4) and may generate side-effects (e.g. evaluation of std::printf(\"%d\", 4) prints the character '4' on the standard output).\n",

    "Some operators are overloaded - `+` is the addition operator for arithmetic types, but the {term}`concatenation` operator for `string` and `char` types.\n",
