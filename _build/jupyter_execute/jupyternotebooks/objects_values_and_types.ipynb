C++ programs also contain literals, the values of characters inside them are determined by character sets and encodings. Certain characters in the program have to be represented with escape sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entities of a C++ program are values, objects, references, structured bindings(since C++17), result bindings(since C++26), functions, enumerators, types, class members, templates, template specializations, packs(since C++11), and namespaces. Preprocessor macros are not C++ entities.\n",

    "Declarations may introduce entities, associate them with names and define their properties. The declarations that define all properties required to use an entity are definitions. A program must contain only one definition of any non-inline function or variable that is odr-used.\n",

    "## `lvalue` and `rvalue`\n",
    "\n",
    "The c++ term ‘‘lvalue’’ was originally coined to mean ‘‘something that can be on the left-hand side of an assignment.’’ – an Lvalue is any object with a memory allocation – i.e. any named object, or an unnamed objected created using new is an lvalue. \n",
    "However, not every lvalue may be used on the left-hand side of an assignment; e.g. an lvalue can refer to a constant. An lvalue that has not been declared const is often called a modifiable lvalue. This simple and low-level notion of an object should not be confused with the notions of class object and object of polymorphic type.\n",
    "Rvalue means ‘‘a value that is not an lvalue,’’ such as a temporary value (e.g., the value returned by a function). \n",
    "If you need to be more technical because you want to read the ISO C++ standard a deeper definition is required. There are two properties that matter for an object when it comes to addressing, copying, and moving: \n",
    "• Has identity: The program has the name of, pointer to, or reference to the object so that it is possible to determine if two objects are the same, whether the value of the object has changed, etc.\n",
    "• Movable: The object may be moved from (i.e., we are allowed to move its value to another location and leave the object in a valid but unspecified state, rather than copying). \n",
    "For practical programming, thinking in terms of rvalue and lvalue is usually sufficient. Note that every expression is either an lvalue or an rvalue, but not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that three of the four possible combinations of those two properties are needed to precisely describe the C++ language rules (we have no need for objects that do not have identity and cannot be moved). Using ‘‘m for movable’’ and ‘‘i for has identity,’’ we can represent this classification of expressions graphically:\n",
    "\n",
    "diagram from week 2 slide 66\n",
    "So, a classical lvalue is something that has identity and cannot be moved (because we could examine it after a move), and a classical rvalue is anything that we are allowed to move from. \n",
    "The other alternatives are prvalue (‘‘pure rvalue’’), glvalue (‘‘generalized lvalue’’), and xvalue (‘‘x’’ for ‘‘extraordinary’’ or ‘‘expert only’’; the suggestions for the meaning of this ‘‘x’’ have been quite imaginative). For example:\n",
    "void f(std::vector<std::string>& vs)\n",
    "{\n",
    "\tstd::vector<std::string>& v2 = std::move(vs); // move vs to v2\n",
    "\t// ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "Here, std::move(vs) is an xvalue: it clearly has identity (we can refer to it as vs), but we have explicitly given permission for it to be moved from by calling std::move().\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we need a new name for a type. Possible reasons include:\n",
    "* The original name is too long, complicated, or ugly (in some programmer’s eyes).\n",
    "* A programming technique requires different types to have the same name in a context.\n",
    "* A specific type is mentioned in one place only to simplify maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "using Pchar = char∗; // pointer to character\n",
    "using PF = int(∗)(double); // pointer to function taking a double and returning an int"
