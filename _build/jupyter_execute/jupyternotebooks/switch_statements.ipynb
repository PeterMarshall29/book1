    "If the case label constant value does not match the value of the condition, then the program ignores the corresponding code block and moves onto the next case. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a value matches, the corresponding statements are executed, followed by the `break` statement, which causes the program to exit the switch-statement and move onto the next statement after the switch-block.\n",

    "If no cases match, then the optional default block is executed, and control is passed on. \n",
