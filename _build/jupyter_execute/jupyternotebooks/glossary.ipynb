    "Assignment\n",
    "  Modification of the current value of an object using an assignment operator. \n",
    "  Simplest case is using the simple assignment operator `=`; i.e. `LHS = RHS;`.\n",
    "  Literal assignment, uses a literal for the RHS. Copy assignment replaces the contents of the LHS object with a copy of the contents of the RHS object (RHS is not modified). Move assignment replaces the contents of the LHS object a with the contents of RHS object, avoiding copying if possible (b may be modified). For non-class types, copy and move assignment are indistinguishable and are referred to as direct assignment.\n",
    "  Compound assignment replaces the contents of the LHS object with the result of a binary operation between the previous value of LHS and the value of RHS e.g. `A = A + B`.\n",
    "  Expression assignment replaces the LHS object with the result of the evaluation of the expression stated on RHS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment Operator\n",
