    "\n",
    "* Making programming more efficient by enabling the reuse of code-blocks.\n",
    "* Reducing the complexity of the overall program by separating concerns - making it easier to write and understand the program because individual parts are separated and identified by a name.\n",
    "* Making it easier to test the program - testing reduces to testing functions and their interactions.\n",

    "Real-world programs use thousands of functions, some even hundreds of thousands of functions. We would never be able to write or understand such programs if their parts (e.g. tasks or computations) were not clearly separated and labelled.\n",

    "Using a function is advisable, even when it will not be reused, because separating individual tasks/computations, and calling them by name makes programmes easier to follow.\n",
