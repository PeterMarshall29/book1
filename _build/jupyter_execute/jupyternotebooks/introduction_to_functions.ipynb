    "## Declarations and Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A definition requires the code body also. ‘Declarations are not definitions’.\n",
    "\n",
    "int myFunction(int); // is a declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "int myFunction(int x) {\n",
    "\tstd::cout << \"Hello Class!\";\n",
    "\treturn x;\n",
    "} //Is a definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also have \n",
    "int myFunction(int) {\n",
    "\tstd::cout << \"Hello Class!\";\n",
    "\treturn 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "But then the integer that must be passed in cannot be accessed or used…\n",
    " \n",
    "You can declare anything as often as you want – only definitions cannot be repeated. \n",
    "And you cannot declare a second time, for the same name that does not match the pattern of an existing definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declarations\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything must be declared before it can be used. \n",
    "Reason: what if you call two functions in each others definition – one definition must come first – the solution is declare both – then it does not matter, which is defined first. And the declaration does not involve the other functions, so no issues there.\n",
    " \n",
    "Kinds of declarations\n",
    "There are many kinds of entities that a programmer can define in C++. The most interesting are:\n",
    "Variables\n",
    "Constants\n",
    "Functions \n",
    "Namespaces \n",
    "Types (classes and enumerations)\n",
    "Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "The declaration is just an interface – describes what the definition has to conform to.\n",
    "extern int myFunction(int);\n",
    "extern keyword means the myFunction declaration is not a definition. It is rarely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Always initialise your variables – prevents accidental use before definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only exception are strings and vectors; which by default have empty conditions initialised, “” for strings, v.capacity() = 0 for vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by a ‘default constructor’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global built-in type variables are initialised with default of 0 – but you should not use global variables in the first place and 0 is just as problematic as no value..\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Declarations – some do not work in current location – others need set up to proceed them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of Declarations\n",
    "The structure of a declaration is defined by the C++ grammar (§iso.A). This grammar evolved over four decades, starting with the early C grammars, and is quite complicated. However, without too many radical simplifications, we can consider a declaration as having five parts (in order):\n",
    "• Optional prefix specifiers (e.g., static or virtual)\n",
    "• A base type (e.g., vector<double> or const int)\n",
    "• A declarator optionally including a name (e.g., p[7], n, or ∗(∗)[])\n",
    "• Optional suffix function specifiers (e.g., const or noexcept)\n",
    "• An optional initializer or function body (e.g., ={7,5,3} or {return x;})\n",
    "Except for function and namespace definitions, a declaration is terminated by a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declaration Good Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the main() put:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Constant declarations\n",
    "Function prototype declarations\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside main() put:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable declarations\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that choice of position affects scope\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hidden or Shadowed Names\n",
    "A declaration of a name in a block can hide a declaration in an enclosing block or a global name.\n",
    "That is, a name can be redefined to refer to a different entity within a block. After exit from the block, the name resumes its previous meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hidden global name can be referred to using the scope resolution operator, ::. For example:\n",
    "int x;\n",
    "void main()\n",
    "{\n",
    "int x = 1; // hide global x\n",
    "::x = 2; // assign to global x\n",
    "x = 3; // assign to local x\n",
    "\n",
    "std::cout << x << '\\n';\n",
    "std::cout << ::x;\n",
    "// ...\n",
    "} \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no way to use a hidden local name."
