    "\n",
    "Creating a Rational Number Struct.\n",
    "Structs is a user-defined type, and a subset of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structs are useful for gathering related variables together into a sequence of arbitrary types called the members of the struct.\n",
    "When a struct is declared a new type is created i.e. declaring a struct called `Date` creates a type called `Date`.\n",
    "Creating a new variable of type `Date` creates an instance of the struct.\n",
    "The individual members of each instance of `Date` are then accessed using the instance name attached to the member name by a period `.`. \n",
    "Stucts, like most types, can be passed into and returned from functions, by value and by reference, or by using a pointer.\n",
    "The members of a struct are held in the order of declaration, so list initialisation is possible.\n",
    "Note: `size0f()` does not work the same for stucts, because of memory layout issues with structs that vary between architectures and implementations.\n",
    "It is best to order members in a struct in size order i.e. largest member first e.g. doubles then ints then chars etc.\n",
    "A struct is declared as follows:\n",
    "```{code-block} cpp\n",
    ":linenos:\n",
    "struct RationalNumber {\n",
    "    int numerator;\n",
    "    int denominator;\n",
    "};\n",
    "Values can be set manually after the creation of an instance of the struct.\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "        RationalNumber myRationalNumber;\n",
    "        myRationalNumber.numerator = 3;\n",
    "        myRationalNumber.denominator = 5;\n",
    "        std::cout << \"My Rational Number = \" << myRationalNumber.numerator << \" / \" << myRationalNumber.denominator << '\\n';\n",
    "        return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "So far the code is not better that just keeping the two integers. First improvement: use a function for initialisation.\n",
    "Values of a struct may also be initialised using a `{}`.\n",
    "```{code-block} cpp\n",

    "This initialisation function passes a reference to the rational number. \n",
