    "# Random Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Many physical phenomena are random e.g. radioactive decay, and others are most easily modelled by treating them as random e.g. Brownian motion - computational physics therefore requires random numbers. It is also often useful to test a program using random numbers - and random numbers can be used to generate distributions. Randomness is the real or apparent absence of any definite patterns or predictability in data/information. The property of randomness is most often used in statistics to signify well-defined statistical properties. Monte Carlo methods rely on random inputs i.e. from a random number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a difference between true randomness and statistical randomness - in both cases the next number cannot be predicted - but in statistical randomness there may be a probability distribution of outcomes i.e. some numbers are more likely to occur than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A numeric sequence is said to be statistically random when it contains no recognizable patterns or regularities, i.e. there is no way to predict what the next number will be, e.g. the digits of $\\pi$ exhibit statistical randomness, in particluar they exhibit a uniform distribution i.e. over a large interval, each of the 10 possible digits appears with equal likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The German Federal Office for Information Security (The Bundesamt\n",
    "fur Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, or BSI) has established\n",
    "criteria for a high quality PRNG:\n",
    "1. A sequence of random numbers has a high probability of containing\n",
    "no identical consecutive elements;\n",
    "2. A sequence of numbers which is indistinguishable from 'true random'\n",
    "numbers (tested using statistical tests); 3. It should be impossible to calculate, or guess, from any given sub-\n",
    "sequence, any previous or future values in the sequence;\n",
    "4. It should be impossible, for all practical purposes, for an attacker to\n",
    "calculate, or guess, the values used in the random number algorithm.\n",
    "Points 3 and 4 are crucial for many applications1\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are very bad a generating random numbers - this is not difficult to understand - computers are only capable of following instructions - what ever algorithm you tell a computer to follow, it will repeated identically every time - so why would the output be different, let alone random? In fact we should expect the output of a computer program to be entirely predictable, barring user mistakes i.e. they are deterministic. \n",
    "\n",
    "The deterministic nature of all programs makes proper randomness impossible. The degree of randomness required for scientific computing applications, or gaming, is quite different to that required for cryptography.\n",

    "In reality, computers generate pseudo-random numbers - a sequence of pseudo random numbers should approximate the properties of a sequence of random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-random number generators (PRNG) are algorithms that generate pseudo-random numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a PRNG runs it produces the same sequence of digits every time, and eventually that sequence will be repeated. The number of digits in each cycle is called the period of PRNG - the higher the number the better e.g. The Mersenne Twister algorithm has a period of $2^{19937}-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic random number generation is not entirely useless, it may be desirable to reproduce calculations involving random numbers, but for cryptography it would be a disaster i.e. once the pattern is established, it becomes possible to predict the next number, facilitating decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "To vary the numbers produced every time the PRNG runs, a seed value is used. The sequence produced for a specific seed value is always the same - and therefore still deterministic and reproducible if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "A PRNG takes an initial value, called the seed, and uses it to produce a sequence of numbers which are supposed to \"look random\". The seed determines the sequence, so you can make the random number generation in a program reproducible by providing an explicit seed. If no seed is provided, a different one will be used each time the program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of the deviates produced depends on the mathematical algorithms used\n",

    "An older implementation of a random number generator in C++ is the rand() function. rand() is not thread-safe, which is a modern problem - older computers had only one core.\n",

    "A call to rand() returns a pseudo-random integer value on [0 and RAND\\_MAX] - repeated calls generate the next number in the sequence generated by the algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly then the key to producing a truly random number would be a random seed - but this just moves the problem along a step.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful way to increase the randomness is to use time for the seed - obvioulsy running the program at the same time every day would generate the same result - but in most cases the starting time would itself be a random event.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<ctime>` library is useful for this purpose and it is standard practice is to use the result of a call to time(0) as the seed. time() returns a time_t value, which is usually an integral type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, the pseudo-random number generator should only be seeded once, before any calls to rand(), and the start of the program. It should not be repeatedly seeded, or reseeded every time you wish to generate a new batch of pseudo-random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For random number generation, there is an additional requirement - a sequence of random numbers must be uncorrelated, and therefore produce the correct distribution over time - which is a standard test.???\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate pseudorandomness - the random number generator must be separated from the program using the random numbers\n",
    "\n",
