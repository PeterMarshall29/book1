    "# Identifiers and Declarations\n",
    "\n",
    "Most entities in the C++ language, such as variables, functions, and classes, have an identifier (a name).\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a program usually requires multiple instances of different entities to be created - each must be given a unique identifier, which is then used within the program text to represent the entity, or its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} No Whitespace in Identifiers!\n",
    ":class: margin warning\n",
    "Whitespace is not permitted in identifiers/names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Longer names are broken up using underscores (bad) or [Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) (good).\n",
    "\n",
    "Special symbols are not permitted.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Identifiers are arbitrarily long sequences of characters - including the digits, underscores, lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, and most Unicode characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers encountered in a program are associated with the declarations that introduced them using a 'name lookup'. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Name\" is generally synonymous with \"identifier\" - but also encompasses keywords, operators, literals, and other things which are not entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each name is normally valid within a part of the program called its {term}`scope`; unless its use has been extended by {term}`linkage`, which enables an identifier to refer to the same entities when they appear in different scopes or translation units.\n",
    "\n",
    "## User-defined Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain words in a C++ program have special meaning and are 'reserved' - meaning they cannot be used as identifiers - these are called {term}`keywords`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any other words may be used as identifiers, unless they have already been used in the same {term}`scope`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A compilation error occurs if the compiler finds two identical identifiers - sometimes called a 'naming collision' or a 'naming conflict' (error).\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    ":class: margin\n",
    "An identifier cannot start with a number!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "````{syntax-start} Rules For Valid Identifiers\n",
    ":class: dropdown \n",
    ":nonumber:\n",
    "````\n",
    "The options for the first character of a valid identifier are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Any uppercase Latin letter, i.e. `A-Z`\n",
    "* Any lowercase Latin letters, i.e `a-z`\n",
    "* An underscore `_`\n",
    "* Some Unicode characters\n",
    "\n",
    "After the initial character the options become:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any digit `0-9`\n",
    "* Any uppercase Latin letter, i.e. `A-Z`\n",
    "* Any lowercase Latin letters, i.e `a-z`\n",
    "* An underscore `_`\n",
    "* Some Unicode characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers are case-sensitive. Any difference in the pattern of symbols creates a new identifier.\n",
    "The variables named `www` and `WWW` are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Naming Conventions for Creating Identifiers\n",
    ":class: dropdown note\n",
    "\n",
    "It is considered best practice to use a consistent writing format for identifiers of the same type - this is called a naming convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, common practices are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An initial capital letter is only used for a {term}`class`. This makes it easy to distinguish a class from a function etc.\n",
    "* Names of functions and variables start with a lower-case letter.\n",
    "* Longer names are generally written in Camel Case, where the name is composed of a series of words, and later words start with capital letters.\n",
    "[Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)\n",
    "* Pointer variables should be prepended with 'p' or 'ptr' and the asterisk '*' should be positioned consistently - either next to the pointer type or next to the variable name.\n",
    "* Reference variables should be prepended with 'r', or 'ref'. This helps to differentiate between the method returning a modifiable object and the same method returning a non-modifiable object\n",
    "* Static variables should be prepended with 's', or 'static'.\n",
    "* Global constants should be all capital letters separated with '_'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "````{Syntax-end}\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Support of Unicode identifiers is limited in most implementations, e.g. gcc (until 10.x).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain words in C++ have special meaning, known as {term}`keywords`, which are reserved for the use of the Language Standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reserved keywords may not be used as object names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of reserved [keywords](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword.html) in the C++ language from the CPP reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declaration\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    ":class: margin\n",
    "Before the `main()` function put:\n",
    "* Constant declarations.\n",
    "* Function prototype declarations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the `main()` function put:\n",
    "*Variable declarations.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before an identifier (name) can be used in a C++ program, it must be declared. \n",
    "\n",
    "Declaration informs the compiler of the existence of an instance of a specified type of entity and establishes its identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{code_example-start} Examples of Declarations\n",

    "Most declarations do not include any values, but some cannot be completed without them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the type is `auto` or declared as `const` then the declaration must include initialisation (a value).\n",
    "\n",
    "````{code_example-end}\n",
    "````\n",
    "### The Structure of Declarations\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a declaration is defined by the C++ grammar and has 5 basics part.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optional prefix specifiers e.g. `static` or `virtual`.\n",
    "* A base type e.g. `vector<double>` or `const int`.\n",
    "* A declarator a name and optionally some declarator operators e.g. `p[7]`, `n`.\n",
    "* Optional suffix function specifiers e.g. `const` or `noexcept`.\n",
    "* An optional initializer or function body e.g. `={7,5,3}` or `{return x;}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for functions and namespace definitions, a declaration is terminated by a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declarators\n",
    "\n",
    "A declarator is the 'name' of the new object found in its declaration, combined with any declarator operators/modifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The type and any type-modifiers are not part of the declarator.\n",

    "Declarators are tricky because they are designed to mirror their use in expressions; for example, `∗` is a ‘prefix’ and `[]` and `()` are both are ‘postfix’ operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "The postfix declarator operators bind tighter than the prefix ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, `char∗kings[]` is an array of pointers to `char`, whereas `char(∗kings)[]` is a pointer to an array of `char`. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary to use parentheses to express types such as ‘pointer to array’ and ‘pointer to function’.\n",
    "\n",
    "`decl-specifier-seq` is the sequence of whitespace separated specifiers, found in a declaration before the declarator, and including the type-specifier and any modifiers.\n",
