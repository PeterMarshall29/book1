    "An {term}`array` is the C++ fundamental method for representing a sequence of objects in memory, part of the core language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple fixed-length sequence of objects, all the same {term}`type`, an array is the ideal solution. However, these 'basic' built-in arrays do no not offer sufficient flexibility and typically programmers prefer to use standard library containers such as `vector`.\n",

    "The number of elements of an array is called the array bound - which must be an integer literal, or a `const int` expression that evaluates to greater than zero and is not optional in a declaration.\n",

    "For a type `T` , `T[N]` is of type 'array of N elements of type T' ; e.g. `int myArray[10]` , has the type 'array of 10 int's' - often just 'int array'.\n",
