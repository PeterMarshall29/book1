    "# Polymorphism \n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism makes it possible to write several versions of the same function each in a different class - considered to be one of the main pillars of object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation inheritance, or run-time polymorphism, reduces effort in implementation by sharing facilities provided by a base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interface inheritance, or compile-time polymorphism, allows different derived classes to be used interchangeably through an interface provided by a common base class.\n",
    "Interface inheritance is often referred to as run-time polymorphism (or dynamic polymorphism).\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement polymorphism, we need to add pointers or references to the use of virtual functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binding\n",
    "\n",
    "Compilers convert your C++ text files into machine language - each line of machine language has it’s a unique sequential address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions then are identified by a unique address. When the program arrives at a function call, the compiler must add a line of machine language dealing with the call.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming **binding** is the process of associating named objects with their properties, e.g. a variable, with its type, and the rules associated - function binding determines which function definition is associate with each function call. When a bound function is called, the process is called dispatching.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of non-member, and non-virtual member, functions - this instruction will be to jump directly to the address of the function code - this is called **early binding** (or, static binding) - the same action is required every time these functions are called and this can be resolved by the compiler at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For virtual member functions - it is not always possible for the compiler to resolve which function is being called at compile time - this is called **late binding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Late binding in C++ used pointers. Late binding may be less efficient than early binding because of additional level of indirection, the compiler program needs to check the current address held for a function pointer, before moving there, but the reward is the additional flexibility required to allow decisions about function calls to be made at execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For virtual member functions late binding is implemented by the creation of a **virtual table**, which is a lookup table created by the compiler, allowing the program to resolve function calls; resolving a call to a virtual function is sometimes called dynamic dispatch."
