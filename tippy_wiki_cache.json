The format indicates the first word starting with either case, then the following words having an initial uppercase letter. Common examples include <i>YouTube</i>, <i>PowerPoint</i>, <i>HarperCollins</i>, <i>FedEx</i>, <i>iPhone</i>, <i>eBay</i>, and <i>LaGuardia</i>. Camel case is often used as a naming convention in computer programming. It is also sometimes used in online usernames such as <i>JohnSmith</i>, and to make multi-word domain names more legible, for example in promoting <i>EasyWidgetCompany.com</i>.</p>", "%22Hello,_World!%22_program": "<p>\nA <b>\"Hello, World!\" program</b> is usually a simple computer program that emits to the screen a message similar to \"Hello, World!\". A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. Such a program is often the first written by a student of a new programming language, but it can also be used as a sanity check to ensure that the computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.</p>", "Coding_best_practices": "<p><b>Coding best practices</b> or <b>programming best practices</b> are a set of informal, sometimes personal, rules that many software developers, in computer programming follow to improve software quality. Many computer programs require being robust and reliable for long periods of time, so any rules need to facilitate both initial development and subsequent maintenance of source code by people other than the original authors.</p>"}
