    "An expression is a sequence of operators and their operands, that specifies a computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression evaluation may produce a result (e.g., evaluation of 2 + 2 produces the result 4) and may generate side-effects (e.g. evaluation of std::printf(\"%d\", 4) prints the character '4' on the standard output).\n",

    "Each C++ expression is characterized by two independent properties: A type and a value category.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations and Operators\n",
    "Each {term}`type` can only be operated on by specific operators - it would not make sense for every operator to work on all types or in the same way on different types. For example, multiplication using `*` on two strings would make no sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some operators are ***overloaded*** - meaning they do work on different types, but not necessarily in the same manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `+` is the addition operator for arithmetic types, but the {term}`concatenation` operator for `string` and `char` types.\n",
    "\n",
