    "# Operations and Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is a sequence of operators and their operands, that specifies a computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression evaluation may produce a result (e.g., evaluation of 2 + 2 produces the result 4) and may generate side-effects (e.g. evaluation of std::printf(\"%d\", 4) prints the character '4' on the standard output).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each C++ expression is characterized by two independent properties: A type and a value category.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Comma Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of a comma in C++ us as a separator. For example, to declare or define multiple values of the same type\n",
    "````{code-block} C++\n",
    "int firstInt = 3, secondInt, thirdInt {4};\n",
    "````\n",
    "Or to separate parameters is a function declaration or call:\n",
    "````{code-block} C++\n",
    "void myFunction (int a, std:string b, bool c) {}\n",
    "````\n",
    "The other use of the comma is the {term}`comma operator`, which enables the evaluation of multiple expression at any point in the code where a single expression might be located.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{code-block} C++\n",
    "(A , B);\n",
    "````\n",
    "The comma operator is particularly dangerous and should be used only if you have no other choice and with great care.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a comma expression `A , B`, the expression A is evaluated, its result is discarded, and its side effects are completed before evaluation of the expression B begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type, value, and value category of the result of the comma expression are exactly the type, value, and value category of the second operand, B. (\n",
    "\n",
    "If B is a temporary expression, the result of the expression is that temporary expression. If B is a bit-field, the result is a bit-field.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the comma operator is needed anywhere that it might be confused with the simple separator comma, then the expression must be parenthesised.\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    int myInt = 10;\n",
    "    std::cout << \"myInt = \" << (++myInt, myInt *= 2 ) << '\\n';\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "`myInt` is incremented and then new value of is passed to the output stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try removing the parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the parentheses, the second argument is discarded, and the result is the first argument. To only achieve the increment, `++myInt` on its own suffices. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parenthesised expression could be replaced with `(myInt + 1) * 2`, which is safer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations and Operators\n",
    "Each {term}`type` can be operated on by specific operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Some operators are overloaded - `+` is the addition operator for arithmetic types, but the {term}`concatenation` operator for `string` and `char` types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers can also overload some operators.\n",

    "## Short Circuiting\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a logical expression can be correctly evaluated without evaluating all the individual expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the condition being checked is: `A && B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only necessary to check that `B` is true, if `A` is found to be true first. If `A == false`, it does not matter what `B` evaluates to because `A && B == false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if the condition is `A || B` then if `A` is true, there is no need to check `B` if p is true, then regardless of the status of `B`, `A || B == true` \n",
    "\n",
    "These two situations are referred to as short-circuit evaluation, which is useful in computing for two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computer resources and time can be saved not completely evaluating some very complex expressions.\n",
    "- Additional Boolean expressions can be used to protect against unsafe conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to prevent a condition throwing a 'division by zero' error, any time a condition involves division by a variable value, it can be logically protected by first checking that the variable is not zero, and short circuiting with logical `&&` or `||`, for example:\n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    "(A != 0) && (A + 1/A < 100) (a == 0) || (a + 1/a < 100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If `a` is ‘0’, the first expression `(a == 0)` is true and the second expression is not\n",
    "evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Order of evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of evaluation of any part of any expression, including the order of evaluation of function arguments, is usually unspecified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The {term}`compiler` can evaluate operands and other subexpressions in any order and may choose another order when the same expression is evaluated again.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no concept of left-to-right or right-to-left evaluation in C++. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to be confused with left-to-right and right-to-left associativity of operators: the expression `a() + b() + c()` is parsed as `(a() + b()) + c()` due to left-to-right associativity of operator `+`, but `c()` may be evaluated first, last, or between `a()` or `b()` at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unspecified Behaviours\n",
    "\n",
    "The behaviour of every part of your code must operate in the way you expect it to, or unexpected outcomes will result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unspecified behaviours are those which may vary between implementations, and which the implementation is not required to document.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of undefined behaviours. Some behaviour varies between implementations and can be allowed for by checking the documentation for your implementation and conforming to the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with unspecified behaviours is that each possible behaviour is valid, and it can be difficult to know what to expect."
