    "## Character Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++ there are a range of character sets and character set encodings available. Char variables are represented by 8 bits, which puts a limit on the character set of 256 items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic, and default character type is `char`. There will be no immediate need to investigate any others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A char-type variable can hold a character of the implementation's character set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Char type is created using single quotes `' '` around a character literal. For example: \n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    "char myCharacter = 'Z';\n",
    "```\n",
    "The character set we are using is called ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange; represents 128 characters chosen to match the characters appearing on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "`0` is used as a null pointer constant, and as the {term}`null character`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different countries with different symbol requirements for their keyboards (e.g., æ, þ, and ß) will use different character sets and you must never rely on `char` values for the execution of a published program.\n",
    "```{admonition} Additional Character Types\n",
    ":class: dropdown \n",
    "* char - the default character type - used for program text - usually 8 bits.\n",
    "* signed char - like char, but for signed character representation - able of holding both positive and negative values.\n",
    "* wchar_t - provided to hold characters of a larger character set such as Unicode. The size of wchar_t is implementation-defined and large enough to hold the largest character set supported by the implementation's locale.\n",
    "* char16_t - a type for holding 16-bit character sets, such as UTF-16.\n",
    "* char32_t - a type for holding 32-bit character sets, such as UTF-32.\n",

    "A string is a variable of type `string` which is composed of a sequence of character literals bracketed by a pair of double quote marks `\" \"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard library component `<string>` defines strings and the operations and functions that work with string-type variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"\"` denotes an empty string, which has the type `const char[1]` - the single character of the empty string is the terminating '\\0'.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Converting `int` to `string`\n",

    "Strings and integers can be printed to the character outputs stream, using separate insertion operations, but integers cannot be concatenated with strings to create a single string.\n",
