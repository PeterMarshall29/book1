Write a program that asks for an integer and tells the user if the number is odd or even.

Write a second program that works for double inputs - this is more complicated, modulo will not work, and you must handle inputs that are not whole numbers.

For Intergers.
```{code-block} c++
#include <iostream> 
int main() {
    int number;
    std::cout << "Please input an integer number to check, even or odd? \n";
    std::cin >> number;
    if (number % 2 == 0) std::cout << "Number is Even!";
    else std:: cout << "Number is Odd!";
    return 0;
}
```
Partial solution for doubles.
```{code-block} c++
#include <iostream> 
int main() {
    double number;
    std::cout << "Please input an integer number to check, even or odd? \n";
    std::cin >> number;
    if (std::remainder(number, 2) == 0) std::cout << "Number is Even!";
    else if (std::remainder(number, 2) == 1.0) std::cout << "Number is Odd!";
    else std::cout << "mmmm, you did not enter a whole numeber...its complicated!";

Try changing this to a while-loop, or to a for-loop - whichever you did not use.
```{code-block} c++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int number, sum = 0;
    std::cout << "Give me a positive integer: ";
    std::cin >> number;
    for (int i = 1; i <= number; ++i) sum += i * i;
    std::cout << "The sum of the squared numbers from 1 to " << number << " is " << sum << '\n';

Write code that produces the following outputs to the terminal. You should use a for-loop. Each consecutive line should display the next value in a:
* count from 0 to 10, in steps of 1.
*	a countdown from 20 to 0 in steps of 0.5.
*	a count up, in steps of 3, from 100 to 121.
*	the multiplication table for 7x.
*	adapt the previous part so that it can produce any multiplication table, for a given number of terms i.e. the 11 times table for 15 terms, so up to 11Ã—15 at the users request.

S_3=\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{i+1}}{i^2}

What happens if you change n?

#include <iostream>
#include <numbers> //requires C++ 2020 or better
int main() {
	int n = 10000;// n is a large number approximating infinity
	double sum = 0.0, numerator = -1.0, denominator;	
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
		numerator = -numerator; 
		denominator = i * i; 
		sum = sum + numerator / denominator; 
	}
	std::cout << "Result of summation is " << sum << '\n';
	std::cout << "pi squated over 12 = " << (std::numbers::pi * std::numbers::pi) / 12;

a.	Write a program that asks the user for a number and then classifies the number as being either: less than 10, between 10 and 100, between 100 and 1000, or greater than 1000.
b.	Modify the last program, to also identify if the number is an integer or not.
c.	Modify the last program to handle input that is not a number correctly.

Write a program to calculate and print to screen the binomial coefficients for the nth power - i.e. the nth line of Pascal's triangle.
By definition, the binomial coefficients are calculated as
```{math}
C(k,n)= \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} 
```
You should know that 
\begin{align}
C(k,n)=C(n-k,n)\\
C(0,n)=1\\
C(1,n)=n\\
C(2,n)=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\
C(k+1,n)=C(k,n)\cdot\frac{n-k}{k+1}

Physicists often need to convert quanitites in one unit into another.
Write a program that asks the user to input, a temperature, the current unit, and the desired unit, and then provides the converted value.
Your program should include the Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Rankine temperature scales.
