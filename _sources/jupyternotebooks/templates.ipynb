    "# Templates Functions and Classes.\n",
    "Templates are used for generalisation and specialisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Templates are used to create generic functions and classes i.e. functions and classes were the return and argument, or parameter, types are not declared in their definitions - this allows the same code logic to be used with different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates are one of two main options for \"generic\" programming. The second option is to use class hierarchies and virtual functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generic programming means writing code that works with a variety of types presented as arguments provided those arguments types meet specific syntactic and semantic requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is often that case that the same code logic needs to applied to different data types -  rather than overload the function (writing multiple functions with the same identifier but different parameter/type lists- remember return types cannot differentiate  overloads). \n",
    "\n",
    "At compile time a set of non-template functions are generated.\n",
    "\n",

    "This is the template header. The function can start on the following line or continue after the header.\n",
    "\n",
    "The identifier `T` is a placeholder for a generic type.  Wherever you would normally place a type name in a function definition, we can now use `T`. If the same type would be specified more than once, then `T` is just repeated. If a second or third type are required, then additional generic type names are required.\n",
    "`T` is traditional in text books, but an identifier may be used, e.g.\n",

    "Don't write a program with templates initially - start with a working version that has an overloaded function, i.e. one for each data type, and then replace the specified types with template parameters; this helps you avoid using some inbuild function that does not work, or behaves differently, for all the types you may consider.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every time the compiler reaches an instance of a template, it assesses both the template and its arguments, in order to determine what code to produce – this ofter requires the program to have a fully defined template everywhere it is used i.e. including member functions and any template functions they call. It is therefore advisable to place all your templates in header files – so they Consequently, template writers tend to place template definitions in header files – not strictly required, but certainly better when the template is required by more than one translation unit. \n",
    "Keep templates as simple as possible.\n",
    "Always test template programmes with all possibly types.\n",
    "Use template based libraries – e.g. the C++ standard library, for generality, type safety, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems using templates\n",
    "\n",
    "The great flexibility and more optimal performance afforded to the programmer by templates do come with some drawbacks. The biggest problem is the poor separation between the inner working of the template (the definition) and the interface (the declaration), which manifests itself in poor error diagnostics, with concomitantly unhelpful error message, that are often produced at a much later point in the compilation process than would be helpful.\n",
    "1.\tIf a single generic type parameter is used more than once, then the supplied types much match\n",
    "\n",
    "Making template parameters more specific i.e. less generic, to increase safety.\n",
    "C++14 provides a mechanism for vastly improved checking of template inter faces. For example, in C++11 we write template class vector { // . . . }; // for all types T We cannot precisely state what is expected of an argument type T. The standard says what these requirements are, but only in English, rather than in code that the compiler can understand. We call a set of requirements on a template argument a concept. A template argument must meet the requirements, the concepts, of the template to which it is applied. For example, a vector requires that its elements can be copied or moved, can have their address taken, and be default constructed (if needed). In other words, an element must meet a set of requirements, which we could call Element. In C++14, we can make that explicit: template requires Element() class vector { // . . . }; // for all types T // such that T is an Elemen\n",
