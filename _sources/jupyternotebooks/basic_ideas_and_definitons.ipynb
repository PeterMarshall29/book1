    "# Extending the Introductory Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have learned some basic components of the C++ language, understanding the language becomes much easier, because you will be able to write simple programmes to try out each new concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page leads you through some basic exercises, much of the explanation is left until later chapters - this page is not intended to present the full syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Computational Physics module, we are mainly concerned with writing programmes that will take user inputs, perform calculations, and then return the 'answers' to the user, which requires us to learn only a subset of the C++ language and programming concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer programme is a sequence of statements, which are executed sequentially when the programme runs.\n",
    "````{admonition} Types of Statement\n",
    ":class: dropdown note\n",
    "C++ includes the following types of statements:\n",
    "* Labelled statements - adds a label to another type of statement, to allow control of the flow.\n",
    "* Expression statements\n",
    "* Compound statements\n",
    "* [Selection](selection) statements\n",
    "* [Iteration](iteration) statements\n",
    "* [Jump statements]\n",
    "````\n",
    "The simplest type of statement is an {term}`expression statement` - i.e. an {term}`expression` followed by a {term}`terminator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are sequences of {term}`operators` and their {term}`operands`, which specify a computation e.g. `a+b` is an expression, `a` and `b` are operands and `+` is an operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the expression statement is executed, the expression is evaluated by the computer, producing a result, which will have a {term}`value` and a {term}`type`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements are always terminated by either a semicolon `;` or by a {term}`code-block` {...some code here...}, which may be empty or contain statements.\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    ":class: margin\n",
    "Only {term}`directives` do not require termination.\n",
    "For example: `#include <iostream>\n",
    "```\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    ":class: margin\n",
    "The Visual Studio IDE indicates a missing `;` by highlighting the start of the next line of code.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Forgetting to terminate a statement, will result in a compile-time error. \n",
    "\n",
    "A semicolon is a statement terminator, and by itself a statement, an {term}`empty statement` (null statement). \n",
    "\n",
    "An expression statement without an expression is called a {term}`null statement`, which may be used to provide an empty body to a for or while loop, or to carry a label in the end of a compound statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Arithmetic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "All programming languages carry out basic arithmetic operations. Normally we do not use a computer as a simple calculator, but most programmes carry out some arithmetic operations as part of their execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "`std::cout` can be used to demonstrate the basic arithmetic operations. \n",

    "\n",
    "At its simplest: like in maths, the {term}`variable` is a {term}`name` that represents a value that will be stored by the computer.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
