    "The two reasons for this are efficiency and safety. If you allow variable’s types to change, you must keep track of what type a variable currently is, which has a cost. Keeping types fixed eliminates that cost. As for safety, consider this: in Javascript, if variable a equals 1 and variable b equals 2, and both are integers, then “a + b” gives 3... if both are text strings, “a + b” gives 12... but what do you get if one is an integer and one is a string? You could make up rules to answer the question, but that just makes things more complicated. It is safer to require programmers to explicitly say whether they want to add two integers or two strings.
