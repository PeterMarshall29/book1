    "* Statement scopes: e.g., in a for-statement\n",

    "* A (member) function declared inside a class only has class scope, and can only be accessed through an object of that class.\n",
    "* Namespace functions are accessed using the namespace name e.g. `std::cout`.\n",

    "## Scoping Rules and Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable with {term}`global scope`  Variables declared outside of all functions or classes have global scope. Global variables are accessible throughout the program, unless shadowed by a local variable with the same name. Global variables are best avoided unless necessary because they may result in unintended consequences in execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to keep in mind the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "In each scope, local variables are used in preference to others with the same name, this is called {term}`shadowing`.\n",
    "A local variable will be used in preference to a global variable of the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables cannot be accessed outside of their scope, loop variable, function parameters only exist inside their scope. Class and struct variables can be accessed by indexing in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make global variable have long detailed names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use global variables if possible, its hard to keep track of which functions may be altering their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of a program is often said to be inversely proportional to the number of global variables as the index of an exponential – keep it to one or two at most.\n",
    " \n",
    "Blocks: Blocks within functions (nested blocks) or other block have their own scope\n",
    "Functions: Local or nested functions\n",
    "Classes: Classes can have member classes; classes within another class, also called nested classes.\n",
    "Local classes are those declared with in functions – best avoided – function is too long if it benefits from the use of a class.\n",
    "A member definition can be outside its class, provided it is declared inside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside: Void f(); // declaration\n",
    "Outside: Void MyClassName::f() {} // the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shadowing\n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually possible to use the same name more than once, provided each declaration has different scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception is the loop variable in a `for` loop. Another type with the s\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declaration Good Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the `main()` function put:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Constant declarations\n",
    "* Function prototype declarations\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the `main()` function put:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Variable declarations\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "Remember that the position chosen for a declaration affects the {term}`scope` of the entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hidden or Shadowed Names\n",
    "A declaration of a name in a block can hide a declaration in an enclosing block or a global name.\n",
    "That is, a name can be redefined to refer to a different entity within a block. After exit from the block, the name resumes its previous meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hidden global name can be referred to using the scope resolution operator, ::. For example:\n",
    "int x;\n",
    "void main()\n",
    "{\n",
    "int x = 1; // hide global x\n",
    "::x = 2; // assign to global x\n",

    "\n",
    "## Namespace\n",
    "Namespace is a language feature exclusively used to express scoping.\n",
    "Creating a namespace allows you to write sperate parts of a longer program without fear that the names used will not have been used elsewhere.\n",

    "Cons of Using Global Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Namespace Pollution: Global variables clutter the global namespace, increasing the risk of naming collisions, especially in large projects or when integrating third-party libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Modularity: They break the encapsulation of functions, making the code less modular and harder to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harder Debugging: Since global variables can be modified from anywhere, tracking down bugs caused by unintended changes becomes challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Overhead: Accessing global variables is slower than accessing local variables due to the scope chain lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Risks: In browser environments, global variables are properties of the window object, making them accessible and modifiable by external scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Consumption: Global variables persist for the lifetime of the program, potentially leading to higher memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compatibility Issues: Global variables can unintentionally override standard APIs or future browser features, causing compatibility problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate the risks of global variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use local variables whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulate variables within functions, modules, or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a namespace object to group related global variables and avoid collisions."
