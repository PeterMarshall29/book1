    "Maintenance: Reduction of modularity makes programs more difficult to maintain. Modular programmes encapsulate everything needed by individual functions and classes into them relying only on information passed on call. \n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging: Global variables can be modified by any part of the program, making it difficult to track down bugs caused by unintended changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution speed: Accessing global variables is often slower than accessing local variables to the scope chain lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Consumption: Global variables occupy space for the lifetime of the program - but may never be needed or used rarely.\n",
