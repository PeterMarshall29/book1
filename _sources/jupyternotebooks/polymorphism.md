(Polymorphism)=
# Polymorphism 

Polymorphism makes it possible to write several versions of the same function each in a different class - considered to be one of the main pillars of object-oriented programming.

Implementation inheritance, or run-time polymorphism, reduces effort in implemenation by sharing facilities provided by a base class.
Interface inheritance, or compile-time polymorphism, allows different derived classes to be used interchangeably through an interface provided by a common base class.
Interface inheritance is often referred to as run-time polymorphism (or dynamic polymorphism)

To implement polymorphism we need to add pointers or references to the use of virtual functions.
