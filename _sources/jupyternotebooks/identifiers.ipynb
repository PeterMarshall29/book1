    "# Identifiers and Declarations\n",
    "\n",
    "Most entities in the C++ language have an identifier (a name).\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a program usually required additional instances of entities to be created by the programmer and each must be given unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} No Whitespace in Identifiers!\n",
    ":class: margin warning\n",
    "Whitespace is not permitted in identifiers/names.\n",
    "Longer names are broken up using underscores or [Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).\n",
    "Special symbols are not permitted.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Identifiers are then used to identify entities in the program text, such as variables, functions and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An identifier is an arbitrarily long sequence of digits, underscores, lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, and most Unicode characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers encountered in a program are associated with the declarations that introduced them using a name lookup. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Name\" is generally synonymous with \"identifier\" - the exceptions are beyond the scope of this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each name is only valid within a part of the program called its {term}`scope`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some names have linkage which makes them refer to the same entities when they appear in different scopes or translation units.\n",
    "\n",
    "## User-defined Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain words in a C++ program have special meaning, and these are known as {term}`keywords`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords may not be used as an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other words may be used as identifiers, unless they have already been used in the same {term}`scope`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A compilation error occurs if the compiler finds two identical identifiers - sometimes called a ‘naming collision’ or ‘naming conflict’ (error).\n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} Rules For Valid Identifiers\n",
    ":class: dropdown \n",
    "The options for the first character are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Any uppercase Latin letter, i.e. `A-Z`\n",
    "* Any lowercase Latin letters, i.e `a-z`\n",
    "* An underscore `_`\n",
    "* Some Unicode characters\n",
    "\n",
    "After the initial character the options become:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any digit `0-9`\n",
    "* Any uppercase Latin letter, i.e. `A-Z`\n",
    "* Any lowercase Latin letters, i.e `a-z`\n",
    "* An underscore `_`\n",
    "* Some Unicode characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers are case-sensitive. Any difference in the pattern of symbols creates a new identifier.\n",
    "The variables named `www` and `WWW` are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Convention for use of Identifiers\n",
    ":class: dropdown tip\n",
    "\n",
    "It is considered best practice to use a consistent writing format for identifiers of the same type - this is called a naming convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An intial capital letter is only used for a {term}`class`. This makes it easy to distinguish a class from a function etc.\n",
    "* Names of functions and variables start with lower case\n",
    "* Longer names are generally written in Camel Case, where the name is composed of a series of words, and later words start with capital letters.\n",
    "[Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)\n",
    "* Pointer variables should be prepended with 'p' and the asterisk '*' should be position next to the variable name instead of the pointer type.\n",
    "* Reference variables should be prepended with 'r'. This helps to differentiate between the method returning a modifiable object and the same method returning a non-modifiable object\n",
    "* Static variables should be prepended with 's'\n",
    "* Global constants should be all capital letters separated with '_'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Support of Unicode identifiers is limited in most implementations, e.g. gcc (until 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain words in a C++ program have special meaning, known as {term}`keywords`, which are reserved\n",
    "\n",
    "The reserved keywords may not be used as object names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of reserved [keywords](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword.html)in the C++ language from the CPP reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declaration\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    ":class: margin\n",
    "Before the `main()` function put:\n",
    "* Constant declarations\n",
    "* Function prototype declarations\n",
    "Inside the `main()` function put:\n",
    "*Variable declarations\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before a name (identifier) can be used in a C++ program, it must be declared. That is, its type must be specified to inform the compiler what kind of entity the name refers to. \n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} Examples of Declarations\n",
    ":class: dropdown note\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} \n",

    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "### The Structure of Declarations\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a declaration is defined by the C++ grammar and has 5 basics part.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optional prefix specifiers (e.g., static or virtual)\n",
    "* A base type (e.g., vector<double> or const int)\n",
    "* A declarator (optionally including a name) (e.g., p[7], n, or ∗(∗)[])\n",
    "* Optional suffix function specifiers (e.g., const or noexcept)\n",
    "* An optional initializer or function body (e.g., ={7,5,3} or {return x;})\n",
    "Except for function and namespace definitions, a declaration is terminated by a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declarators\n",
    "\n",
    "A declarator is the 'name' of the new object found in its declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The declarator is composed of the object's identifier and any declarator operators/modifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The type, any type-modifiers are not part of the declarator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} c++\n",
    ":name: Examples of Declarators\n",
    "int myInt;                    // myInt is the declarator\n",
    "double *myDouble;             //myDouble is the identifier, *myDouble is the declarator\n",
    "int myIntArray[256];          //myIntArray[256] is the declarator, myIntArray is the identifier\n",
    "volatile int * sequence [5];  //*sequence[5] is the declarator\n",

    "Declarators are tricky because they are designed to mirror their use in expressions; for example `∗` is a ‘prefix’ and `[]` and `()` are both ‘postfix’. \n",
    "\n",
    "The postfix declarator operators bind tighter than the prefix ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, char∗kings[] is an array of pointers to char, whereas char(∗kings)[] is a pointer to an array of char. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary to use parentheses to express types such as ‘pointer to array’ and ‘pointer to function’.\n",
    "\n",
    "`decl-specifier-seq` is the sequence of whitespace separated specifiers, found in a declaration before the declarator, and including the type-specifier and any modifiers."
