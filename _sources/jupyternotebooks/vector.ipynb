    "Instead, a `for` loop is needed.\n",

    "## Traversing a Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "The range for any vector is the halfopen sequence [0 : v.size() ) meaning 0 is included, but the last element is v.size()-1 .\n",
    "\n",
    "A “range for loop” uses this halfopen sequence .\n",

    "## Adding to a Vector\n",

    "A non-existent element cannot be accessed or assigned to in any type of vector or array.\n",

    "push_back(17) is another member function – it belongs to std::vector and must be called using the . notation – like methods for swift structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ also has arrays like  C – but these need to have their size specified in advance – vector is more useful usually – going to cover those in a later week.\n",

    "The second term is the condition for the for loop – std::cin >> works if it is given the correct variable type by the user and therefore returns true , otherwise false and the for loop ends.\n",
    "Vector has many useful member functions. We can sort out list into ascending order – or otherwise.\n",
