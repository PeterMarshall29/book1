    "As an example of iteration, consider the first program ever to run on a stored-program computer (the EDSAC). \n",

    "It was written and run by David Wheeler in the computer laboratory in Cambridge University, England, on May 6, 1949, to calculate and print a simple list of squares like this:\n",

    "int i = 0;\n",
    "while (i < 100) {\n",
    "std::cout << i << \"\\t\" << i * i << \"\\n\";\n",

    "}\n",
    "Its usually best to use a for loop – even if you want it to run forever – shown later on. If you know how many iterations are required, use a for loop. If you want it to possibly keep running still use a for loop – it cannot be set up without a condition."
