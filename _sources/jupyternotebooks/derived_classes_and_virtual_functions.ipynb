    "A **derived class** (or sub-class) is a new class that inherits properties from a **base Class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are described as base classes (or super-classes) when other classess are derived from them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using derived class creates a hierarchical relationship between a group of classes.  For example we could define the class `Mammal` and the class `Insect` to share properties of the class `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of derived classes and inheritance is the basis of Object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "A derived class **inherits** the properties of the base class, but then adds more data and functions - derived classes are larger and, although often called subclasses, they have a superset of the data of an instance of the base class.\n",

    "Data members may only be initialised by a constructor of the same class they are declared in.\n",

Since we want to call the member function `dispayInfo()` we need to make the derived class from a public declared base class.\n",

    "**Virtual member functions**, also know **methods** allow the programmer to declare functions in a base class that can be redefined in each derived class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Declaring a particular function as `virtual` in the base class allows that function identifier to act as an interface to the definitions of the function in both the base and derived classes.
