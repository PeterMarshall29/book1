    "Computer languages are just complicated sets of instructions. It can be difficult at first to work out what the cppreference website or textbooks are telling you because of the large amount of new vocabulary.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pschologist Carol Dweck developed the theory of the growth and fixed mindsets. People with a growth mindset believe that their abilities, intelligence, and talents can be developed through effort, learning, and persistence. They understand that their brain is akin to a muscled that is strengthened by practice and struggling with new ideas and acivities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fixed mindset believes that you are either good at something or not - this is usually wrong and always self defeating. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most students will not just know more when they leave university - they will be smarter - as a result of the work they have done. **WORK** is the important part of the sentence - if you coast through your studies you will not improve."
