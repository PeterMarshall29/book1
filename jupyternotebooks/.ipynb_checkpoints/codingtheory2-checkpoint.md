## Error Types

There are many types of error, but three classifications to understand at this point are:
- Compile time – found by compiler – easily fixed.
- Link-time errors found by linker – more difficult. 
- Run-time errors, or logic errors, occur after successful creation of the .exe file. Too late to fix – people have died!
